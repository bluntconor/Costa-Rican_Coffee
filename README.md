Project Info; The performance of three genotypes of Coffee was investigated
              A- arabica
              R- Robusta
              A/R- arabica and robusta root:shoot unionised grafted plant
A and R are control plants whilst A/R is the test subject.they were investigated on their performace under Shade and Sun conditions denoted as Block 1 and 2. the performace parameter is denoted at PN within the study. the Cheif influencing factors on to this PN value is Block and Genotype. Time of day is also another important parameter. 

Project Goal; Compare performace of A/R to controls. See if it performs better under shade conditions

Dependant variable: PN
Independant catagorical variables: Block Geno Time
